MacOS's bill-of-materials (BOM) files reader/writer library that is
fuzz-tested against the original `mkbom` and `lsbom` utilities.
Includes re-implementation of these utilities as well.


## Introduction

`stuckliste` is a library that offers types and methods for reading/writing MacOS bill-of-materials (BOM) files.
These files are generic storage container for various type of information
with the most common type being _receipts_ â€”
files that contains a list of all files and directories owned by a package and
that are usually stored under `/Library/Receipts`.
The library is fuzz-tested against MacOS's `mkbom` and `lsbom` utilities ensuring that 
it produces structurely the same output.


## Installation

The easiest way to use `stuckliste` is via command line interface.

```bash
cargo install stuckliste-cli
```


## Usage


### As a command-line application

```bash
mkbom /tmp /tmp/receipt.bom
lsbom /tmp/receipt.bom
```


### As a library

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Error;
use stuckliste::receipt::{Receipt, ReceiptBuilder};

fn create_receipt() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let file = File::create("/tmp/receipt.bom")?;
    let receipt = ReceiptBuilder::new().create("/tmp")?;
    receipt.write(file)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn read_receipt() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let file = File::open("/tmp/receipt.bom")?;
    let receipt = Receipt::read(file)?;
    for (path, metadata) in receipt.entries()?.into_iter() {
        println!("{:?}: {:?}", path, metadata);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```
