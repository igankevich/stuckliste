# BOM file format reference


## Regular blocks, named blocks and file header

Bill-of-materials (BOM) files store arbitrary data in regular and named blocks.
A _regular block_ is characterized by its offset from the start of the file and its size in bytes.
A _named block_ is a regular block that is also characterized by its human-readable name.
BOM file starts with the header which is padded to 512 bytes.
The header includes magic bytes and block specification (offset and size) for regular blocks and named blocks â€”
special blocks that store information on regular and named blocks respectively.
Usually these special blocks are located at the end of the file to simplify updates.

The following tables summarize the internal structure of the aforementioned entities.

### <a name="header"></a>File header

| Field | Type | Explanation | Value |
|------------|------|-------|-------------|
| `magic` | `[u8; 8]` | File signature. | `"BOMStore"` |
| `version` | `u32` | Entity version. | 1 |
| `num_non_null_blocks` | `u32` | No. of unoccupied blocks. |
| `regular_blocks` | [`Block`](#block) | Block that stores information on [regular blocks](#regular-blocks). |
| `named_blocks` | [`Block`](#block) | Block that stores information on [named blocks](#named-blocks). |

### <a name="block"></a>Block

| Field | Type | Explanation |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `offset` | `u32` | Block offset from the start of the file. | 
| `size` | `u32` | Block size. | 

### <a name="regular-blocks"></a>Regular blocks

| Field | Type | Explanation |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `num_occupied_blocks` | `u32` | No. of occupied regular blocks, i.e. blocks with non-zero length that store some other entity. |
| `occupied_block[0]` | [`Block`](#block) | First occupied block. |
| `occupied_block[1]` | [`Block`](#block) | Second occupied block. |
| ... | | |
| `occupied_block[num_occupied_blocks-1]` | [`Block`](#block) | Last occupied block. |
| `num_free_blocks` | `u32` | No. of free regular blocks, i.e. blocks with zero length that can be used to store new entities on file update. |
| `free_block[0]` | [`Block`](#block) | First free block. |
| `free_block[1]` | [`Block`](#block) | Second free block. |
| ... | | |
| `free_block[num_free_blocks - 1]` | [`Block`](#block) | Last free block. |

### <a name="named-blocks"></a>Named blocks

Block index here and everywhere else means the index in the list of [regular blocks](#regular-blocks).

| Field | Type | Explanation |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `num_named_blocks` | `u32` | No. of named blocks. |
| `name[0]` | `CStr` | Null-terminated first block name. |
| `index[0]` | `u32` | First block index. |
| `name[1]` | `CStr` | Null-terminated second block name. |
| `index[1]` | `u32` | Second block index. |
| ... | | |
| `name[num_named_blocks-1]` | `CStr` | Null-terminated last block name. |
| `index[num_named_blocks-1]` | `u32` | Last block index. |


## Trees

The information in the blocks can be stored in any format,
but usually it is stored as key/value tables called _trees_.
A tree is itself stored in several blocks depending on how many entries it contains.
There are _data nodes_ that store key/value block indices and
_meta nodes_ that store block indices that point to data nodes.
Probably such a hierarchical structure was the reason for calling them _trees_.

The following tables summarize the internal structure of the trees.

### <a name="tree"></a>Tree

| Field | Type | Explanation | Value |
|------------|------|-------|-------------|
| `magic` | `[u8; 4]` | Tree signature. | `"tree"` |
| `version` | `u32` | Entity version. | 1 |
| `root` | `u32` | Block index of the root node. Can point to either meta or data node. | |
| `block_size` | `u32` | Block size that is used to allocate tree nodes. Usually it is 4096 for large trees and 128 for small ones. | |
| `num_entries` | `u32` | Total no. of key/value entries in the tree. | |
| `unknown` | `u8` | | 0 |

### <a name="tree-data-node"></a>Data node

| Field | Type | Explanation |
|------------|------|-------|
| `flags` | `u16` | Equals 1 if it is a data node, 0 otherwise. | 1 |
| `num_entries` | `u16` | No. of entries in this particular tree node. |
| `next` | `u32` | Block index of the next data node. |
| `prev` | `u32` | Block index of the previous data node. |
| `key[0]` | `u32` | Block index of the first entry's key. |
| `value[0]` | `u32` | Block index of the first entry's value. |
| ... | | |
| `key[num_entries-1]` | `u32` | Block index of the last entry's key. |
| `value[num_entries-1]` | `u32` | Block index of the last entry's value. |

### <a name="tree-meta-node"></a>Meta node

In this node keys always point to data nodes and
values point to the last value in the corresponding data node.
It is unclear how the values are used.

| Field | Type | Explanation |
|------------|------|-------|
| `flags` | `u16` | Equals 1 if it is a data node, 0 otherwise. | 0 |
| `num_entries` | `u16` | No. of entries in this particular tree node. |
| `next` | `u32` | Block index of the next meta node. |
| `prev` | `u32` | Block index of the previous meta node. |
| `key[0]` | `u32` | Block index of the first entry's key. |
| `value[0]` | `u32` | Block index of the first entry's value. |
| ... | | |
| `key[num_entries-1]` | `u32` | Block index of the last entry's key. |
| `value[num_entries-1]` | `u32` | Block index of the last entry's value. |
